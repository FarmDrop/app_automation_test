Welcome to the farmdrop technical test for automation testers(app)

Please spend no more than one hours on the following task. This is as much to understand how you approach things as it is to see if you can build working tests.

Background

This is a 

cd onto the location of the directory 
run pod upgrade from a CLI
Then on xcode open the Farmdrop.xcworkspace file


Task

Please write a test for the producer search which will run against this app.

Use Appium/calabash/xamarin/apple's UI testing/Ruby and any other gems/frameworks you feel are appropriate.


Notes

Code reuse is important to us, so we are interested in seeing what approaches you take to keep your code and tests modular.
We take version control seriously, so please show us how you approach this.
Can you show an approach to handle multiple simulators as well.
Your submission should include instructions on how to run it.


Submission

Please fork this repository and commit code to it. Send us the link to your repo in an email.

Good Luck!!!
